# Diffusion-in-polymer-brush

Scripts for setting up and performing the simulations are in the 'Scripts'-folder.

Scripts for analyzing the results are in the 'Analysis'-folder.

Some example data are in the 'Example_data'-folder. Note that the data sets are not complete, and that different system types may have different formats of the indices_for_fit-files (see the relevant diffusion_avgandrms-files if you want to use the scripts).

See README.pdf for more details.
